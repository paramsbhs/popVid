## What inspired me to create this tool?

### Whenever I would go on transit or I am out on a long road trip, I would have a problem of not being able to get a quick study session in. But watching TikToks in vertical format? Perfectly fine. This is why, I created my own educational app to stay focused and teach myself, and the world, technical interview questions for Computer Science.
