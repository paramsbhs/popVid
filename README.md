## How is popVid created?

### popVid uses the MERN stack. (MongoDB, Express, ReactJS, NodeJS), I upload videos on a CDN server to get a link, which I can then send a POST request to MongoDB. popVid will also soon come with a React Native version for mobile versions.
### Frontend: React, Firebase
### Backend: Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, Mongoose, Heroku

## What inspired me to create this tool?

### Whenever I would go on transit or I am out on a long road trip, I would have a problem of not being able to get a quick study session in. But watching TikToks in vertical format? Perfectly fine. This is why, I created my own educational app to stay focused and teach myself, and the world, technical interview questions for Computer Science.
